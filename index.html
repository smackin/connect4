<h3> Rules of the Game </h3>

  Player 1 (purple) and Player 2 (green) alternate turns. <br>
  On each turn, click the top column where you would like a piece dropped down a column.<br> 
  Once a player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, vert, or diag) they Win! <br>
  Unless you fill the board, then we have a tie.  <br>
